# TheAwaited

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.0, Express JS and MongoDB.

## Development server

1. Run command `npm install` at root folder to install all dependencies.
2. Run command `npm run server` for starting the backend server. This will listen on port `3000`.
3. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
4. The MongoDB will be setup automatically, No command needed for the same.

Above steps would make the project initiate properly and the same can be checked on `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
